### Moonshot Objective: Reduce the R0 to < 1 by October 1, 2020


We're trying to predict & prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections by:

**1. Using wearables to detect variances in resting heart rate, sleep, & body temperature** 

Studies show that resting heart rate data measured from a Fitbit can predict influenza-like illnesses at the state level. We're extending this study to detect COVID-19.


**2. Crowdsourcing self-reported symptom checks**

Along with passive, synchronous, and physiological data analysis, we're crowdsourcing self-reported symptom checks. Daily check-ins can help understand where the greatest needs will be.


**3. Gamifying self-quarantine, isolation, & social distancing protocols**

Let's apply behavioral economics & gamification techniques that incentivize people to follow the best protocols for their situation. Let's make it helpful, fun and less scary. We can have leaderboards for the most time stayed at home, mint cryptocurrency for daily check-ins, etc.

The end goal is to get ahead of the coronavirus infection and flatten the curve before our healthcare system collapses even more.
