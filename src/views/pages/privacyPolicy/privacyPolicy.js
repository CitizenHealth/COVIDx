      <h2>Data Sharing and Privacy Notice</h2>
      <p>
        In this Policy, we, Citizen Health LCA, explain how we 
        process personal data that you share via our application, 
        COVIDx  ("app"). Citizen Health is a Public Benefit Limited 
        Cooperative Association trying to help beat COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Sharing.</strong>  Our app is a tool that 
        you can use to share data on your health and well-being 
        with us, healthcare organizations, researchers, academics, 
        public health authorities, law enforcement and others. 
        With our data privacy and security measures, we are trying 
        to strike a healthy balance between urgent healthcare needs 
        and individual privacy considering published research and 
        guidance by privacy law scholars, including Healthy Data Protection, 
        http://ssrn.com/abstract=3357990.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Categories.</strong>  When you use the app, 
        you are sharing with us the responses to our questions that 
        you choose to answer, including how you feel and whether you 
        tested positive for COVID-19. We will improve our app and 
        amend our questions from time to time. We are also 
        collecting wearable device data including but not limited to; 
        Heart Rate, Sleep, Steps, Activity and other Health Metrics 
        capable of assessing your overall health. We also ask that you 
        share your location via device settings or in response to a 
        question. We are not asking your name and will use a token 
        or other unique identifiers to recognize your data related to one 
        person so we can avoid duplicate reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purposes of Processing.</strong>  We want to help beat 
        COVID-19 and other infectious diseases by enabling all of us 
        to share data about our health more quickly, more widely, on 
        a larger scale with those who are working on cures, tests, 
        vaccination, containment and other healthcare measures. Your data 
        may therefore be used in research studies and other statistical 
        assessments. By donating your data to us you are consenting to 
        having your data run on the COVIDx platform (“app”). If we choose 
        to engage third parties in data transactions, we will notify you 
        and ask for your consent. You have the option to opt-in or opt-out 
        of these transactions. We are working on means to provide you 
        with monetary offers or other promotions in exchange for your 
        COVIDx data. This policy will update when those offers become 
        available. No current offers of money, promotions, gifts, 
        IOU’s, exchanges, future value, or any other compensation is 
        available at the inception of this Policy. This Policy will list 
        any third parties we are working with and their information will 
        appear at the end of this Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Recipients.</strong>  We want to make aggregate 
        data from the app publicly available. We will use discretion and 
        make judgement calls based on input from our medical advisory board 
        and subject to applicable law with whom we share data that you 
        donated individually, likely including research institutions, 
        government authorities and businesses in the healthcare sector. 
        We understand that we may be compelled by a government authority to 
        share individual data for contact tracing purposes, or we may determine 
        this is necessary to protect you or others, even though this is not 
        our plan or purpose and we do not collect your name. Separately, we 
        engage services providers to process data on our behalf subject to 
        confidentiality and data protection terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Security.</strong>  We limit the collection of data 
        categories to what we need for our mission to enable all of us 
        to share data on our health. We deploy firewalls, anti-virus software, 
        encryption-at-rest and internal data access restrictions to 
        reduce the risk of unauthorized access to personal data. We use Google 
        reCAPTCHA to protect the App from abuse (see 
        www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html regarding functionality and 
        Google's data processing practices)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Retention and Deletion.</strong>  We are planning to 
        keep data collected as long as we operate for scientific, medical 
        research and healthcare purposes. If you would like us to delete 
        your data, please email us at team@citizenhealth.io. Please allow 
        10 business days for us to complete this transaction. If you would 
        like a confirmation that this action has been completed, please write 
        this in your correspondence to us. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Effective Date and Changes to this Notice.</strong>  This Policy 
        is effective April 1, 2020 our original launch date. We expect to 
        update this notice frequently as we improve our app under the intense 
        time pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic and will post revised 
        versions of this Policy in the "About" section of our app and where 
        you can download our app.
